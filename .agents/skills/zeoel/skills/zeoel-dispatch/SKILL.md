# Zeoel Phase 3: Execution Dispatcher

## Overview

Execute the sprint plan by dispatching the correct Zeoel sub-agent for each task. You (Gohar/CEO) act as the Orchestrator — reading the plan and spinning up the assigned agent with their full skill context.

<HARD-GATE>
REFUSE to execute unless ALL of the following are true:
1. `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` exists and is approved
2. `docs/sprint-N/plan.md` exists for the current sprint
3. `docs/sprint-N/progress.md` exists for the current sprint
4. `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md` exists for the current sprint

If any are missing, tell the user which phase is incomplete and redirect them.
</HARD-GATE>

---

## Mandatory Sub-Agent Dispatch Protocol

For EVERY task in `docs/sprint-N/plan.md`, follow this EXACT 8-step protocol:

### Step 1: Identify the Assigned Agent
Read the task table in `plan.md`. Note the assigned agent, their listed skills, and the **required tests** column.

**Parallel Dispatch Guidelines:** If multiple tasks are independent (e.g., Tariq building a backend API and Karar building a frontend UI component), Gohar may dispatch parallel sub-agents concurrently. Ensure independent tasks do not conflict in the same files.

### Step 2: Read the Agent Definition
Read the agent's persona file:
```
.agents/skills/zeoel/agents/[name].md
```
Extract:
- **Persona** — their personality, biases, and tendencies
- **Skill Bindings** — the complete list of skills they can use
- **Constraints & Anti-Patterns** — what they MUST and MUST NOT do
- **Output Format** — what files/format they should produce
- **Testing Protocol** — what tests they MUST produce

### Step 3: Load Primary (⭐) Skill SKILL.md Files
For each ⭐ (starred) skill in the agent's Skill Bindings:
```
.agents/skills/zeoel/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md
```
Load only the ⭐ skills by default. Load additional skills only if the specific task requires them.

### Step 4: Announce the Dispatch
Before writing any code, announce:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  DISPATCHING: [Name] ([Role])
  Task: [Task # — Task description]
  Skills Loaded: [list of ⭐ skills]
  Required Tests: [what tests this task must produce]
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 5: Execute the Task (with Mandatory Tests)
The agent completes the task using ONLY their bound skills.
- Stay in character — use the agent's persona, expertise, and constraints.
- Follow their Output Format specification.
- Do NOT use skills outside their bindings.

**TEST MANDATE — STRICT RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD:**
Read and follow `.agents/skills/zeoel/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`.
You MUST:
1. **RED**: Write a failing test first. Verify it fails.
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make it pass.
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up the code.
If you write implementation code before a failing test exists, you have failed the process.
| Task Type | Required Tests | Agent |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| React component | Component test (`.test.tsx`) using Vitest + Testing Library | Karar |
| Next.js page/route | Integration test for the route + accessibility assertions | Karar |
| Laravel controller/route | Feature Test (PHPUnit) for every endpoint | Tariq |
| Laravel Service/Action | Unit Test for every public method | Tariq |
| Auth/protected endpoint | Security test assertions (auth bypass, invalid tokens, RBAC) | Tariq |
| Input validation | Validation boundary tests (XSS, SQL injection, oversized input) | Tariq |
| Database migration | Migration rollback test | Tariq |
| Tenant-scoped query | Tenant isolation verification test | Tariq |
| Flutter widget | Widget test using WidgetTester | Hassan |
| Python function/module | pytest test file | Gohar(Py)/Fatima |
| CI/CD pipeline | Pipeline validation test | Ali |
| API endpoint (any) | Request/response contract test | Tariq/Gohar(Py) |

**If a task produces code but NO tests, the task is NOT done. Go back and write the tests.**

### Step 6: Review, Track, and Return

**A. Two-Stage Review & Verification Before Completion:**
1. **Spec Compliance**: Does the code do EXACTLY what the task asked? No more, no less. (YAGNI)
2. **Code Quality**: Would Muhammad (QA) or Sajjad (Perf) flag any issues with this code?
3. **Test Review**: Do test files exist? Did you follow Red-Green-Refactor?
4. **Verification**: DO NOT GUESS. You must actually compile the code and run the tests to PROVE the task is complete. Never assume it works without verification.

**B. Update Progress Tracker:**
Update `docs/sprint-N/progress.md`:
- Mark the task status: ✅ Done, ❌ Blocked, or 🔨 In progress
- Record test files created in the Notes column
- Add timestamp of the update

**C. Drop the Persona:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  COMPLETED: Task [#] — [description]
  Tests Created: [list test files]
  Returning to Gohar (CEO)
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 7: Post-Task Checkpoint (BLOCKING)

<HARD-GATE>
You MUST NOT move to the next task until ALL of the following are TRUE:

1. ✅ `docs/sprint-N/progress.md` has been updated with this task's status
2. ✅ Test files exist for all new code produced by this task
3. ✅ If any feature/scope was cut or deferred → logged in `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md`
4. ✅ If any bugs were discovered → logged in `progress.md` Bugs Found section

If ANY of these are false, complete them NOW before moving to the next task.
</HARD-GATE>

### Step 8: Incremental Audit Check (Every 3 Tasks)

After every 3 completed tasks, run a **mini audit cycle**:

1. **Muhammad (QA) Quick Review**:
   - Are all test files present for the last 3 tasks?
   - Do tests pass?
   - Append findings to `docs/qa/sprint-N-signoff.md` (create if first audit)

2. **Ali (Security) Quick Scan**:
   - Any hardcoded secrets in the last 3 tasks?
   - Any auth/validation gaps?
   - Append findings to `docs/security/sprint-N-audit.md` (create if first audit)

3. **Zara (SEO) Quick Check** (if any public pages were built):
   - Do new pages have metadata exports?
   - Is heading hierarchy correct?
   - Append findings to `docs/seo/sprint-N-audit.md` (create if first audit)

**The incremental audit ensures issues are caught early, not just at Phase 4.**

After the audit, **update `docs/sprint-N/progress.md`** with an audit checkpoint note:
```
### Audit Checkpoint (after Task #N)
- QA: [PASS/issues found]
- Security: [PASS/issues found]
- SEO: [PASS/N/A]
```

**Then move to the next task.**

## Status Handling

If a sub-agent reports:
- **DONE**: Proceed to the two-stage review, then the Post-Task Checkpoint (Step 7), then next task.
- **BLOCKED**: Step in as Gohar to assess. Break the task down further, or ask the user for help. Log the blocker in `progress.md`.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT**: Provide the missing files/context to the agent and retry. Do NOT guess.
- **DEFERRED**: Log the deferred item in `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md` with reason and priority. Mark the task as ⏭️ Deferred in `progress.md`.

---

## Deferred Items Protocol

After EVERY task, check: **Was anything cut, simplified, or deferred?**

If YES, immediately update `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md`:

```markdown
| # | Item | Original Task | Reason | Priority | Target Sprint |
|---|------|--------------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | [what was deferred] | Task #N | [why] | P1/P2/P3 | Sprint N+1 |
```

Also update `docs/deferred/backlog.md` (the cumulative master list):
```markdown
| # | Item | Source Sprint | Reason | Priority | Status |
|---|------|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [item] | Sprint N | [why] | P1 | ⬜ Pending |
```

**Deferred items MUST be reviewed at the start of the next sprint during Phase 2 planning.**

---

## Phase 4: Verify & Ship (End of Sprint)

When ALL sprint tasks are marked ✅ in `progress.md`, execute Phase 4 in this EXACT order:

### Step 1: QA Sign-Off
Dispatch **Muhammad (QA)** — Read `agents/muhammad-qa.md`, load `e2e-testing` + `webapp-testing`:
- Verify ALL task-level tests exist and pass
- Run E2E tests (Playwright) for all pages/flows
- Update `docs/tests/sprint-N-coverage.md` with coverage summary
- File bugs in `progress.md` under "Bugs Found"
- If bugs are blockers: dispatch the original agent to fix, then re-test
- **Finalize** `docs/qa/sprint-N-signoff.md` (merge incremental notes + final results)

### Step 2: Security Audit
Dispatch **Ali (DevOps)** — Read `agents/ali-devops.md`, load `zeoel-security` + `security-review`:
- Run OWASP ASI compliance check
- Verify all security tests pass (auth bypass, input validation, tenant isolation)
- **Finalize** `docs/security/sprint-N-audit.md` (merge incremental notes + full audit)

### Step 3: SEO Audit (if public pages exist)
Dispatch **Zara (SEO)** — Read `agents/zara-content.md`, load `seo`:
- Verify heading hierarchy, meta, JSON-LD, sitemap
- **Finalize** `docs/seo/sprint-N-audit.md` (merge incremental notes + full audit)

### Step 4: Sprint Handoff

<HARD-GATE>
You MUST NOT write `docs/sprint-N/done.md` until ALL of the following files exist AND are finalized:

1. ✅ `docs/qa/sprint-N-signoff.md` — exists and says PASS (or all blockers resolved)
2. ✅ `docs/security/sprint-N-audit.md` — exists and all critical issues resolved
3. ✅ `docs/seo/sprint-N-audit.md` — exists (or sprint had NO public pages — document this)
4. ✅ `docs/tests/sprint-N-coverage.md` — exists with test counts and coverage
5. ✅ `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md` — exists (even if empty — document "nothing deferred")
6. ✅ `docs/deferred/backlog.md` — updated with any new deferred items
7. ✅ All tasks in `docs/sprint-N/progress.md` are ✅ Done or ⏭️ Deferred (with logged reasons)

If ANY item is missing, STOP and complete it FIRST. Do NOT skip.
</HARD-GATE>

Gohar (CEO) then writes:
- `docs/sprint-N/done.md` — using the template from `references/sprint-plan-template.md`
- Updates `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — sprint status section, current state section
- Updates `docs/deferred/backlog.md` — mark sprint items as reviewed

## Mandatory Phase 4 Checklist

Before declaring a sprint DONE, ALL of these MUST be true:

- [ ] All tasks in `docs/sprint-N/progress.md` are marked ✅ Done or ⏭️ Deferred
- [ ] Every task that produced code also produced corresponding test files
- [ ] `docs/tests/sprint-N-coverage.md` exists with test summary
- [ ] `docs/qa/sprint-N-signoff.md` exists and says PASS
- [ ] `docs/security/sprint-N-audit.md` exists and all criticals resolved
- [ ] `docs/seo/sprint-N-audit.md` exists (or documented as N/A with reason)
- [ ] `docs/sprint-N/deferred.md` exists (even if empty)
- [ ] `docs/deferred/backlog.md` is updated
- [ ] `docs/sprint-N/done.md` is written
- [ ] `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` sprint status is updated

**If ANY item is missing, the sprint is NOT done. Complete the missing items first.**
